Project  Proposal for AOSSIE

Project Summary
Project: Ell-ena: AI-Powered Personal Assistant/Manager

Idea: Building a mobile-first, AI-powered personal assistant that helps users manage tasks through natural language, with a focus on context awareness and relationship tracking.
Project Size: Large (350+ hours)
Project Length: 20 weeks
Project Vision and Motivation
Vision
Ell-ena addresses the fundamental problem of cognitive load in task management. As a student, I've experienced how information fragmentation across multiple apps creates mental overhead. Traditional productivity tools force users to adapt to rigid structures, while Ell-ena adapts to natural human communication patterns.

The project is technically significant because it combines several emerging technologies in novel ways. The Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system represents an advancement over traditional RAG approaches by incorporating relationship awareness. This hybrid approach enables more nuanced context retrieval that understands both semantic similarity and explicit relationships between entities.

Motivation
I am the best person to execute this proposal because I have a deep understanding of both the problem space and the technical solutions. My experience with mobile development and database design positions me well to implement the proposed architecture. I've conducted extensive research on AI technologies, particularly in the areas of natural language processing and context management.

I approach technical challenges with a focus on simplicity and maintainability. Rather than overcomplicating solutions, I believe in understanding core concepts deeply and applying them elegantly. This philosophy will guide the development of Ell-ena, ensuring it remains both powerful and accessible.

Detailed Proposal Description 
Ell-ena is a mobile-first, AI-powered personal assistant that helps users manage tasks through natural language. The core innovation is a Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that maintains context and understands relationships between tasks, projects, and people.

Technical Architecture

The system follows a clean, modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

![Ell-ena System Architecture](systemdesign.png)

*Figure 1: High-level system architecture showing the interaction between Mobile Frontend, Backend API, and AI Integration components*

1. Frontend (React Native + Expo)
   - Chat-based UI as the primary interaction method
   - Offline-first approach with local storage and background sync
   - Responsive design with platform-specific optimizations

2. Backend (Fastify + TypeScript)
   - RESTful API with proper validation and error handling
   - JWT-based authentication with refresh token rotation
   - Modular service architecture for maintainability

3. Database Layer
   - PostgreSQL for structured data (users, tasks, workspaces)
   - Neo4j for graph relationships between entities
   - Write-through pattern to maintain consistency between databases

4. AI Services
   - OpenAI API integration (GPT-4, Whisper, Embeddings)
   - Custom prompt engineering for task extraction
   - Hybrid retrieval system combining vector and graph approaches

The Graph RAG system is the technical innovation that makes Ell-ena special. Traditional RAG systems use vector embeddings to find semantically similar content, but they lack awareness of explicit relationships. Our approach combines:

- Vector embeddings for semantic search across all content
- Graph database for tracking explicit relationships (dependencies, assignments, etc.)
- Hybrid retrieval that leverages both approaches based on query intent

This architecture enables Ell-ena to understand complex queries by retrieving both semantically similar content and related entities through graph traversal. For example, when a user asks "What tasks depend on the research phase?", Ell-ena can use graph traversal to find all tasks with a dependency relationship to the research phase, even if the query doesn't contain the exact keywords.

Key Features

1. Natural Language Task Creation
   - Intent classification to determine user's goal
   - Entity extraction for task details (title, deadline, priority)
   - Context-aware parsing that considers recent conversations
   - Structured output generation with validation

2. Meeting Transcription & Summarization
   - Audio processing with noise reduction
   - Speaker diarization for multi-participant meetings
   - Task extraction from transcripts using NLP
   - Summary generation with key points and action items

3. Contextual Awareness
   - Conversation history with relevance scoring
   - Relationship tracking between tasks, projects, and people
   - Temporal awareness for time-sensitive queries
   - Workspace isolation for multi-project support

4. Unified Mobile Experience
   - Chat-first interface with typing indicators
   - Offline support with conflict resolution
   - Background synchronization with status indicators
   - Responsive design for various screen sizes

Implementation Approach

For the NLP pipeline, I'll implement a multi-stage approach:

1. Context Collection: Gather relevant past messages, workspace information, and user preferences
2. Intent Detection: Classify the message type (task creation, query, update, etc.)
3. Entity Extraction: Extract task details using carefully crafted prompts
4. Structured Output: Generate validated task objects with proper typing

For the Graph RAG system, I'll use:

1. Vector Database: Store embeddings for all content (tasks, messages, etc.)
2. Graph Database: Track relationships between entities
3. Hybrid Retrieval: Combine vector similarity with graph traversal
4. Context Formatting: Structure retrieved information for the LLM

This approach balances technical sophistication with practical usability, ensuring Ell-ena remains both powerful and accessible.

Any Other Relevant Information

Ell-ena represents a significant technical challenge that combines mobile development, natural language processing, and database design. The Graph-based RAG system is particularly innovative, as it addresses limitations in traditional RAG approaches by incorporating relationship awareness.

I approach technical challenges with a focus on simplicity and maintainability. Rather than overcomplicating solutions, I believe in understanding core concepts deeply and applying them elegantly. This philosophy will guide the development of Ell-ena, ensuring it remains both powerful and accessible.

The project is well-suited for GSoC because it has clear deliverables, a realistic timeline, and addresses a real-world problem. I'm confident that with the guidance of AOSSIE mentors, I can successfully implement this vision and create a valuable tool for users.
