### Project Abstract

Ell-ena is a mobile-first, AI-powered Product Manager + Personal Assistant that helps users manage tasks, create tickets, transcribe meetings, and retain full contextual awareness through natural language. The project aims to build a sophisticated chat-based interface where users can create tasks, receive reminders, transcribe meetings, and maintain context across multiple sessions.

Unlike traditional task managers or note-taking apps, Ell-ena functions as an intelligent assistant that understands the relationships between tasks, remembers past interactions, and helps users organize their thoughts and work seamlessly.

### Project Description

#### Problem Statement

Knowledge workers, students, and professionals face several challenges when managing their tasks and information:

1. **Context Switching**: Constantly moving between different tools disrupts workflow and reduces productivity.
2. **Information Fragmentation**: Important details are scattered across different apps, notes, and messages.
3. **Cognitive Load**: Keeping track of deadlines, commitments, and follow-ups is mentally taxing.
4. **Limited AI Integration**: Existing tools lack sophisticated AI capabilities for natural language understanding.

#### Solution

Ell-ena addresses these challenges by providing:

1. **Unified Interface**: A single chat-based interface for all task management and information capture.
2. **Contextual Awareness**: An AI that remembers past conversations and maintains relationships between entities.
3. **Natural Language Processing**: Ability to parse and structure natural language inputs into actionable items.
4. **Seamless Integration**: Connection with calendars and other productivity tools for a cohesive workflow.

#### Core Features to Implement

1. **Chat-based User Interface**
   - Implement a React Native mobile app with a conversational interface
   - Design responsive UI components for task visualization and management

2. **Backend API & Database**
   - Develop a Fastify-based API server with TypeScript
   - Implement Supabase integration for authentication and data storage
   - Design and implement PostgreSQL schema for tasks, users, and workspaces

3. **AI Integration**
   - Implement OpenAI API integration for natural language parsing
   - Design prompt templates for converting unstructured text to structured task objects
   - Develop an extraction pipeline for meetings transcription

4. **Context Graph (Stretch Goal)**
   - Implement a graph database (Neo4j/Weaviate) for storing relationships
   - Create a semantic search capability for retrieving related tasks and context

### Technical Architecture

The project will be implemented using a modern tech stack:

1. **Frontend**: React Native + Expo
   - Gifted Chat for the chat interface
   - React Navigation for app navigation
   - AsyncStorage for local data caching
   - Expo AV for audio recording

2. **Backend**: Fastify + TypeScript
   - RESTful API design for all endpoints
   - JWT authentication with Supabase
   - Swagger documentation for API endpoints

3. **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
   - Relational data model for core entities
   - Row-level security for data protection
   - Real-time subscriptions for updates

4. **AI Services**:
   - OpenAI API for NLP and task extraction
   - Whisper API for audio transcription
   - Vector embeddings for semantic search
