# Ell-ena: AI-Powered Personal Assistant

## GSoC 2025 Project Proposal

Hello! I'm Sauhard Gupta, a freshman at BITS Pilani, and this documentation outlines my proposal for Google Summer of Code 2025: **Ell-ena** - an AI-powered personal assistant that helps users manage tasks through natural language.

## Project Vision

As a student juggling courses, projects, and extracurriculars, I've experienced firsthand the chaos of managing tasks across multiple apps. Ell-ena represents what I wish existed: an intelligent assistant that understands natural language, remembers context, and organizes responsibilities in one place.

The name "Ell-ena" combines "ELL" (Enhanced Language Learning) with a personified assistant name - creating something that feels both technical and approachable.

## Documentation Structure

This documentation outlines my plans for Ell-ena:

### Project Basics
- [Project Overview](project-overview.md) - Core concept and vision
- [Technical Requirements](TRD.md) - Technical specifications and architecture
- [Original Proposal](proposal.md) - My initial GSoC project proposal

### Implementation Plans
- [System Architecture](system-architecture.md) - Proposed architecture design
- [AI Integration](ai-integration.md) - How I'll integrate language models and NLP
- [NLP System](nlp-system.md) - Natural language understanding approach
- [Graph-based RAG](graph-rag.md) - Context-aware retrieval system

### Development Roadmap
- [Implementation Plan](implementation-plan.md) - Week-by-week development plan
- [Future Roadmap](future-roadmap.md) - Long-term vision
- [Challenges & Solutions](challenges-solutions.md) - Anticipated challenges and approaches

### API & Reference
- [API Reference](api-reference.md) - Planned API endpoints

## Proposed Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React Native + Expo
- **Backend:** Fastify + TypeScript
- **Databases:** PostgreSQL (relational data) + Neo4j (graph relationships)
- **AI:** OpenAI API (GPT-4, Whisper, Embeddings)

## About Me

I'm a freshman Computer Science student with a passion for building tools that solve real problems. While I'm new to some of the technologies I'm proposing (particularly the AI/NLP components), I'm excited to learn and grow through this project.

My experience includes [briefly mention relevant experience or coursework].

## Why I'm Excited About This Project

This project sits at the intersection of several fascinating areas: mobile development, natural language processing, and graph-based knowledge representation. Building Ell-ena will push me to learn rapidly and create something genuinely useful.

I believe the best way to learn is by doing, and GSoC provides the perfect opportunity to dive deep into these technologies with mentorship and support.

I'm not just proposing an app; I'm proposing to build the tool I wish existed for students and professionals everywhere.
